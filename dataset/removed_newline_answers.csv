In fact, to avoid the problem of having to have a script examine the live database to determine what ALTERs to run, I usually work like this:</p><ul><li>On the first version, I place everything during testing into one SQL script, and treat all tables as a CREATE.  This means I end up dropping and readding tables a lot during testing, but that's not a big deal early into the project (since I'm usually hacking the data I'm using at that point anyway).</li><li>On all subsequent versions, I do two things: I make a new text file to hold the upgrade SQL scripts, that contain just the ALTERs for that version.  And I make the changes to the original, create a fresh database script as well.  This way an upgrade just runs the upgrade script, but if we have to recreate the DB we don't need to run 100 scripts to get there.</li><li>Depending on how I'm deploying the DB changes, I'll also usually put a version table in the DB that holds the version of the DB.  Then, rather than make any human decisions about which scripts to run, whatever code I have running the create/upgrade scripts uses the version to determine what to run.</li></ul><p>The one thing this will not do is help if part of what you're moving from test to production is data, but if you want to manage structure and not pay for a nice, but expensive DB management package, is really not very difficult.

My understanding is that once it gets to a system loadLibrary call (i.e. Java has found the library in its java.library.path and is now telling the OS to load it) - it is completely dependent on the operating system to find any dependent libraries, because at that point it is the operating system that is loading the library for the process, and the OS only knows how to look in the system path. That seems hard to set in the case of a Webstart app, but there is a way around this that does not involve static compiling. You may be able to shuffle where your libraries are - I am unsure </p><p>If you use a custom classloader, you can override loadLibrary and findLibrary so that it can locate your libraries from within a jar in your classpath, and if you also make it aware of your native library dependencies (i.e. libB depends on libA depends on libX, then when loading libB you can catch yourself and ensure you load libA first, and in checking that notice and load libX first.

5607,581.0,2008-08-08T03:04:29Z,5600,31,"<p>When dealing with indexes, you have to determine what your table is going to be used for.  If you are primarily inserting 1000 rows a second and not doing any querying, then a clustered index is a hit to performance.  If you are doing 1000 queries a second, then not having an index will lead to very bad performance.  The best thing to do when trying to tune queries/indexes is to use the Query Plan Analyzer and SQL Profiler in SQL Server.  This will show you where you are running into costly table scans or other performance blockers.</p><p>As for the GUID vs ID argument, you can find people online that swear by both.  I have always been taught to use GUIDs unless I have a really good reason not to.  Jeff has a good post that talks about the reasons for using GUIDs: <a href=""http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000817.html"">http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000817.html</a>.</p><p>As with most anything development related, if you are looking to improve performance there is not one, single right answer.  It really depends on what you are trying to accomplish and how you are implementing the solution.  The only true answer is to test, test, and test again against performance metrics to ensure that you are meeting your goals.</p><p>[Edit]@Matt, after doing some more research on the GUID/ID debate I came across this post.  Like I mentioned before, there is not a true right or wrong answer.  It depends on your specific implementation needs.  But these are some pretty valid reasons to use GUIDs as the primary key:</p><blockquote>  <p>For example, there is an issue known as a ""hotspot"", where certain pages of data in a table are under relatively high currency contention. Basically, what happens is most of the traffic on a table (and hence page-level locks) occurs on a small area of the table, towards the end. New records will always go to this hotspot, because IDENTITY is a sequential number generator. These inserts are troublesome because they require Exlusive page lock on the page they are added to (the hotspot). This effectively serializes all inserts to a table thanks to the page locking mechanism. NewID() on the other hand does not suffer from hotspots. Values generated using the NewID() function are only sequential for short bursts of inserts (where the function is being called very quickly, such as during a multi-row insert), which causes the inserted rows to spread randomly throughout the table's data pages instead of all at the end - thus eliminating a hotspot from inserts.</p>    <p>Also, because the inserts are randomly distributed, the chance of page splits is greatly reduced. While a page split here and there isnt too bad, the effects do add up quickly. With IDENTITY, page Fill Factor is pretty useless as a tuning mechanism and might as well be set to 100% - rows will never be inserted in any page but the last one. With NewID(), you can actually make use of Fill Factor as a performance-enabling tool. You can set Fill Factor to a level that approximates estimated volume growth between index rebuilds, and then schedule the rebuilds during off-peak hours using dbcc reindex. This effectively delays the performance hits of page splits until off-peak times.</p>    <p>If you even <em>think</em> you might need to enable replication for the table in question - then you might as well make the PK a uniqueidentifier and flag the guid field as ROWGUIDCOL. Replication will require a uniquely valued guid field with this attribute, and it will add one if none exists. If a suitable field exists, then it will just use the one thats there.</p>    <p>Yet another huge benefit for using GUIDs for PKs is the fact that the value is indeed guaranteed unique - not just among all values generated by <em>this</em> server, but all values generated by <em>all</em> computers - whether it be your db server, web server, app server, or client machine. Pretty much every modern language has the capability of generating a valid guid now - in .NET you can use System.Guid.NewGuid. This is VERY handy when dealing with cached master-detail datasets in particular. You dont have to employ crazy temporary keying schemes just to relate your records together before they are committed. You just fetch a perfectly valid new Guid from the operating system for each new record's permanent key value at the time the record is created. </p>    <p><a href=""http://forums.asp.net/t/264350.aspx"">http://forums.asp.net/t/264350.aspx</a></p></blockquote>"

However, you're concerned about polluting your domain model with the 'plumbing' code that would be necessary to read and write to your object's fields.</p><p>Taking a step back, you essentially have two choices of where to put your data mapping code - within the domain class itself or in an external mapping class.The first option is often called the Active Record pattern and has the advantage that each object knows how to persist itself and has sufficient access to its internal structure to allow it to perform the mapping without needing to expose non-business related fields.</p><p>E.g</p><pre><code>public class User{	private string name;	private AccountStatus status;	private User()	{	}	public string Name	{		get { return name; }		set { name = value; }	}	public AccountStatus Status	{		get { return status; }	}	public void Activate()	{		status = AccountStatus.Active;	}	public void Suspend()	{		status = AccountStatus.Suspended;	}	public static User GetById(int id)	{		User fetchedUser = new User();		// Lots of database and error-checking code		// omitted for clarity		// ...		fetchedUser.name = (string) reader[""Name""];		fetchedUser.status = (int)reader[""statusCode""] == 0 ? AccountStatus.Suspended : AccountStatus.Active;		return fetchedUser;	}	public static void Save(User user)	{		// Code to save User's internal structure to database		// ...	}}</code></pre><p>In this example, we have an object that represents a User with a Name and an AccountStatus. We don't want to allow the Status to be set directly, perhaps because we want to check that the change is a valid status transition, so we don't have a setter. Fortunately, the mapping code in the GetById and Save static methods have full access to the object's name and status fields.</p><p>The second option is to have a second class that is responsible for the mapping. This has the advantage of seperating out the different concerns of business logic and persistence which can allow your design to be more testable and flexible. The challenge with this method is how to expose the name and status fields to the external class. Some options are:  1. Use reflection (which has no qualms about digging deep into your object's private parts)  2. Provide specially-named, public setters (e.g. prefix them with the word 'Private') and hope no one uses them accidentally  3. If your language suports it, make the setters internal but grant your data mapper module access. E.g. use the InternalsVisibleToAttribute in .NET 2.0 onwards or friend functions in C++</p><p>For more information, I'd recommend Martin Fowler's classic book 'Patterns of Enterprise Architecture'</p><p>However, as a word of warning, before going down the path of writing your own mappers I'd strongly recommend looking at using a 3rd-party object relational mapper (ORM) tool such as nHibernate or Microsoft's Entity Framework. I've worked on four different projects where, for various reasons, we wrote our own mapper and it is very easy to waste a lot of time maintaining and extending the mapper instead of writing code that provides end user value. I've used nHibernate on one project so far and, although it has quite a steep learning curve initially, the investment you put in early on pays off considerably.</p>"

You'll have to see what, in particular, bounds the quality of your data.  Here are basic descriptions:</p><ol><li><p>Between any two points in your data, (x(0),y(0)) and (x(n),y(n)), add up y(i+1)-y(i) for 0 &lt;= i &lt; n and call this T (""travel"") and set R (""rise"") to y(n)- y(0) + k for suitably small k.  T/R > 1 indicates a peak.  This works OK if large travel due to noise is unlikely or if noise distributes symmetrically around a base curve shape.  For your application, accept the earliest peak with a score above a given threshold, or analyze the curve of travel per rise values for more interesting properties.</p></li><li><p>Use matched filters to score similarity to a standard peak shape (essentially, use a normalized dot-product against some shape to get a cosine-metric of similarity)</p></li><li><p>Deconvolve against a standard peak shape and check for high values (though I often find 2 to be less sensitive to noise for simple instrumentation output).</p></li><li><p>Smooth the data and check for triplets of equally spaced points where, if x0 &lt; x1 &lt; x2, y1 > 0.5*(y0+y2), or check Euclidean distances like this:  D((x0,y0),(x1,y1)) + D((x1,y1),(x2,y2)) > D((x0,y0),(x2,y2)), which relies on the triangle inequality.  Using simple ratios will again provide you a scoring mechanism.</p></li><li><p>Fit a very simple 2-gaussian mixture model to your data (for example, Numerical Recipes has a nice ready-made chunk of code).  Take the earlier peak.  This will deal correctly with overlapping peaks.</p></li><li><p>Find the best match in the data to a simple Gaussian, Cauchy, Poisson, or what-have-you curve.  Evaluate this curve over a broad range and subtract it from a copy of the data after noting it's peak location.  Repeat.  Take the earliest peak whose model parameters (standard deviation probably, but some applications might care about kurtosis or other features) meet some criterion.  Watch out for artifacts left behind when peaks are subtracted from the data.Best match might be determined by the kind of match scoring suggested in #2 above.</p></li></ol><p>I've done what you're doing before:  finding peaks in DNA sequence data, finding peaks in derivatives estimated from measured curves, and finding peaks in histograms.</p><p>I encourage you to attend carefully to proper baselining.  Wiener filtering or other filtering or simple histogram analysis is often an easy way to baseline in the presence of noise.</p><p>Finally, if your data is typically noisy and you're getting data off the card as unreferenced single-ended output (or even referenced, just not differential), and if you're averaging lots of observations into each data point, try sorting those observations and throwing away the first and last quartile and averaging what remains.

For example, PMD comes with the <a href=""http://pmd.sourceforge.net/howtowritearule.html"">""designer"" tool</a> that allows you to create new rules. Also, Checkstyle has the <a href=""http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/config_misc.html#DescendantToken"">DescendantToken</a> check that has properties that allow for substantial customization.</p><p><p>I integrate these tools with <a href=""http://virtualteamtls.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/virtualteamtls/trunk/scm/common.xml?view=markup"">an Ant-based build</a>. You can follow the link to see my commented configuration.</p><p><p>In addition to the simple integration into the build, I find it helpful to configure the tools to be somewhat ""integrated"" in a couple of other ways. Namely, report generation and warning suppression uniformity. I'd like to add these aspects to this discussion (which should probably have the ""static-analysis"" tag also): how are folks configuring these tools to create a ""unified"" solution? (I've asked this question separately <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/79918/configuring-static-analysis-tools-for-uniformity"">here</a>)</p><p><p>First, for warning reports, I transform the output so that each warning has the simple format:</p><pre><code>/absolute-path/filename:line-number:column-number: warning(tool-name): message</code></pre><p><p>This is often called the ""Emacs format,"" but even if you aren't using Emacs, it's a reasonable format for homogenizing reports. For example:</p><pre><code>/project/src/com/example/Foo.java:425:9: warning(Checkstyle):Missing a Javadoc comment.</code></pre><p><p>My warning format transformations are done by my Ant script with Ant <a href=""http://ant.apache.org/manual/Types/filterchain.html"">filterchains</a>.</p><p><p>The second ""integration"" that I do is for warning suppression. By default, each tool supports comments or an annotation (or both) that you can place in your code to silence a warning that you want to ignore. But these various warning suppression requests do not have a consistent look which seems somewhat silly. When you're suppressing a warning, you're suppressing a warning, so why not always write ""<code>SuppressWarning</code>?""</p><p><p>For example, PMD's default configuration suppresses warning generation on lines of code with the string ""<code>NOPMD</code>"" in a comment. Also, PMD supports Java's <code>@SuppressWarnings</code> annotation. I configure PMD to use comments containing ""<code>SuppressWarning(PMD.</code>"" instead of <code>NOPMD</code> so that PMD suppressions look alike. I fill in the particular rule that is violated when using the comment style suppression:</p><pre><code>// SuppressWarnings(PMD.PreserveStackTrace) justification: (false positive) exceptions are chained</code></pre><p><p>Only the ""<code>SuppressWarnings(PMD.</code>"" part is significant for a comment, but it is consistent with PMD's support for the <code>@SuppressWarning</code> annotation which does recognize individual rule violations by name:</p><pre><code>@SuppressWarnings(""PMD.CompareObjectsWithEquals"") // justification: identity comparision intended</code></pre><p><p>Similarly, Checkstyle suppresses warning generation between pairs of comments (no annotation support is provided). By default, comments to turn Checkstyle off and on contain the strings <code>CHECKSTYLE:OFF</code> and <code>CHECKSTYLE:ON</code>, respectively. Changing this configuration (with Checkstyle's ""SuppressionCommentFilter"") to use the strings ""<code>BEGIN&nbsp;SuppressWarnings(CheckStyle.</code>"" and ""<code>END&nbsp;SuppressWarnings(CheckStyle.</code>"" makes the controls look more like PMD:</p><pre><code>// BEGIN SuppressWarnings(Checkstyle.HiddenField) justification: ""Effective Java,"" 2nd ed., Bloch, Item 2</code><code>// END SuppressWarnings(Checkstyle.HiddenField)</code></pre><p><p>With Checkstyle comments, the particular check violation (<code>HiddenField</code>) <em>is</em> significant because each check has its own ""<code>BEGIN/END</code>"" comment pair.</p><p><p>FindBugs also supports warning generation suppression with a <code>@SuppressWarnings</code> annotation, so no further configuration is required to achieve some level of uniformity with other tools. Unfortunately, Findbugs has to support a custom <code>@SuppressWarnings</code> annotation because the built-in Java <code>@SuppressWarnings</code> annotation has a <code>SOURCE</code> retention policy which is not strong enough to retain the annotation in the class file where FindBugs needs it. I fully qualify FindBugs warnings suppressions to avoid clashing with Java's <code>@SuppressWarnings</code> annotation:</p><pre><code>@edu.umd.cs.findbugs.annotations.SuppressWarnings(""UWF&#95;FIELD&#95;NOT&#95;INITIALIZED&#95;IN&#95;CONSTRUCTOR"")</code></pre><p><p>These techniques makes things look reasonably consistent across tools. Note that having each warning suppression contain the string ""<code>SuppressWarnings</code>"" makes it easy to run a simple search to find all instances for all tools over an entire code base.</p>"

However, I do find Selenium to be incredibly useful for performing those sort of acceptance and sanity tests on the UI.</p><p>A good way to get started is using Selenium IDE as part of your development. Ie, just have the IDE open as you're developing and write your test as you go to cut down on your dev time. (Instead of having to manually go through the UI to get to the point where you can test whatever you're working on, just hit a button and Selenium IDE will take care of that for you. It's a terrific time-saver!)</p><p>Most of my major use case scenarios have Selenium RC tests to back them up. You can't really think of them as unit-tests along the lines of an xUnit framework, but they are tests targetted to very specific functionality. They're quick to write (especially if you implement common methods for things like logging in or setting up your test cases), quick to run, and provide a very tight feedback loop. In those senses Selenium RC tests are very <em>similar</em> to unit-tests.</p><p>I think, like anything else, if you put the effort into properly learning a test tool (eg, Selenium), your effort will pay off in spades.

We have a variety of Service-based applications that do exactly what you are asking.  Typically, we parse the incoming file and wrap our own Postscript or PCL around it.  If you layout is fairly simple, then there are some very basic PCL codes you can wrap it with to provide the font/print layup you want (I'd be more then happy to give you some guidance here offline).</p><p>One you have a print ready file you can send it to a UNC printer that is shared, directly to a locally installed printer, or even to the IP of the device (RAW or LPR type data).</p><p>If, however, you are going down the PDF path, the simplest method is to send the PDF output to a printer that supports direct PDF printing (many do now). In this case you just send the PDF to the device and away it prints. </p><p>The other option is to launch <a href=""http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/"" rel=""nofollow"">Ghostscript</a> which should be free for your needs (check the licensing as they have a few different version, some GNU, some GPL etc.) and either use it's built in print function or simply convert to Postscript and send to the device.

You probably have a function like dbconnect() and you are using variables from an include file to make the connection. $conn = mysql_connect($dbhost, $dbuser, $dbpass).</p><p>Well since this is inside a function the variables from the include file need to be passed to the function or else the function will not know what $dbhost, $dbuser and $dbpass is.

Each part of that  <em>tree</em> is a type of node containing different kinds of data. DOM (Document Object Model) was necessary because of the diversity of HTML pages that early web browsers (Netscape, IE...) implemented to allow alter the appearance and content of a web page without reloading it.

But often, you do not want to jump that far anyway. Instead, you get a much faster query that might be able to fetch data in constant time, depending on your indexing. Plus, your pages remain ""stable"", no matter if the underlying data changes (e.g. on page 1, while you're on page 4).</p><p>This is the best way to implement paging when lazy loading more data in web applications, for instance.</p><p>Note, the ""seek method"" is also called <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/3215973/521799"">keyset paging</a>.</p>"

An approach that I have implemented in my framework. All  autocomplete elements are generated with an hidden input like this :</p><pre><code>&lt;? $r = rmd5(rand().mocrotime(TRUE)); ?&gt;&lt;form method=""POST"" action=""./""&gt;    &lt;input type=""text"" name=""&lt;? echo $r; ?&gt;"" /&gt;    &lt;input type=""hidden"" name=""__autocomplete_fix_&lt;? echo $r; ?&gt;"" value=""username"" /&gt;    &lt;input type=""submit"" name=""submit"" value=""submit"" /&gt;&lt;/form&gt;</code></pre><p>Server then process post variables like this :</p><pre><code>foreach ($_POST as $key =&gt; $val){    if(preg_match('#^__autocomplete_fix_#', $key) === 1){        $n = substr($key, 19);        if(isset($_POST[$n]))$_POST[$val] = $_POST[$n];    }}</code></pre><p>The value can be accessed as usual</p><pre><code>var_dump($_POST['username']);</code></pre><p>And the browser won't be able to suggest information from previous request or from previous users.</p><p>All works like a charm, even if browsers updates, wants to ignore autocomplete or not. That has been the best way to fix the issue for me.</p>"

The only difference between the two code snippets is the source of the first move instruction, and both are offsets relative to ds, implying that both refer to baked-in constants.</p></li><li><p>Testing for equality against the empty string, as either a literal or the string.Empty property, sets up a two-argument function call, which indicates <em>inequality</em> by returning zero. I base this conclusion on other tests that I performed a couple of months ago, in which I followed some of my own code across the managed/unmanaged divide and back. In all cases, any call that required two or more arguments put the first argument in register ECX, and and the second in register EDX. I don't recall how subsequent arguments were passed. Nevertheless, the call setup looked more like __fastcall than __stdcall. Likewise, the expected return values always showed up in register EAX, which is almost universal.</p></li><li><p>Testing the length of the string sets up a one-argument function call, which returns 1 (in register EAX), which happens to be the length of the string being tested.</p></li><li><p>Given that the immediately visible machine code is almost identical, the only reason that I can imagine that would account for the better performance of the string equality over the sting length reported by <strong>Shinny</strong> is that the two-argument function that performs the comparison is significantly better optimized than the one-argument function that reads the length off the string instance.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>As a matter of principle, I avoid comparing against the empty string as a literal, because the empty string literal can appear ambiguous in source code. To that end, my .NET helper classes have long defined the empty string as a constant. Though I use <strong>string.Empty</strong> for direct, inline comparisons, the constant earns its keep for defining other constants whose value is the empty string, because a constant cannot be assigned <strong>string.Empty</strong> as its value.</p><p>This exercise settles, once and for all, any concern I might have about the cost, if any, of comparing against either <strong>string.Empty</strong> or the constant defined by my helper classes.</p><p>However, it also raises a puzzling question to replace it; why is comparing against <strong>string.Empty</strong> more efficient than testing the length of the string? Or is the test used by Shinny invalidated because by the way the loop is implemented? (I find that hard to believe, but, then again, I've been fooled before, as I'm sure you have, too!)</p><p>I have long assumed that <strong>system.string</strong> objects were counted strings, fundamentally similar to the long established Basic String (BSTR) that we have long known from COM.</p>"
